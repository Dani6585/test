    <h3>About FEMA</h3>
    <p>For 38 years, FEMA's mission remains: to lead America to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from disasters with a vision of "A Nation Prepared." 

        On April 1, 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed the executive order that created the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  From day one, FEMA has remained committed to protecting and serving the American people. That commitment to the people we serve and the belief in our survivor centric mission will never change.
        
        The Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinates the federal government's role in preparing for, preventing, mitigating the effects of, responding to, and recovering from all domestic disasters, whether natural or man-made, including acts of terror.
        
        FEMA can trace its beginnings to the Congressional Act of 1803. This act, generally considered the first piece of disaster legislation, provided assistance to a New Hampshire town following an extensive fire.
        
        In the century that followed, ad hoc legislation was passed more than 100 times in response to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters.</p>
    <h3>After hurricane Irma with FEMA</h3>
    <p>Many individuals and families in Florida are moving forward in their recovery from Hurricane Irma with help from FEMA, the state, and non-profit entities; individuals remain a priority. But numerous public buildings, roads, and bridges were also damaged or destroyed.

        State and local governments spent millions of dollars on overtime for first responders and other workers, and millions more removing debris from streets and public property. Who pays for those expenses?
        
        The Public Assistance program, FEMAâ€™s largest grant program, averages $4.7 billion nationally in assistance each year and accounts for just over half of the grant dollars administered by the agency.
        
        After a declared disaster, the program pays for storm-generated debris removal, the cost of preparing for and responding to the disaster, and the repair or replacement of eligible public infrastructure, including roads and bridges; public buildings and equipment; utilities including water systems and parks and other recreational facilities.
        
        FEMA approves grants and provides technical assistance to the state and applicants. The state helps educate applicants about the program and the application process, and distributes and monitors grant funds.
        
        In addition, PA encourages protection of damaged facilities and infrastructure from future disasters by providing funding for hazard mitigation measures during the recovery process that make buildings or structures more resilient.
        
        Local and state applicants are responsible for identifying storm damage and other eligible costs, for providing documentation and managing the funded projects.</p>
