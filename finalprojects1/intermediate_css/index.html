    <h3>The Story of Hurricane Irma</h3>
    <p>It’s 14 hours before Hurricane Irma, the biggest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic, is supposed to pass through this spot. The National Weather Service warns it could be the most powerful hurricane in living memory. The Big One everyone’s been waiting for. It could be catastrophic in its devastation, the governor says. The mayor of Miami-Dade County opens a record number of shelters and goes on TV to plead with people to heed mandatory evacuation orders. The circles under his eyes are mauve. Floridians are tense. People squabble at gas stations over dwindling fuel and throw punches over the cost of plywood. Interstate 75, which runs like a vein down Florida’s spine, is jammed with families trying to get north, to get out. I-95 and the Florida Turnpike aren’t much better. One man turns around at Fort Lauderdale and goes home. “I’d rather hunker down in my house than in my car,” he says.
        By the time the rain arrives on Saturday, it almost feels like a relief. Hurricane Irma, the monster storm Miami has been anticipating for a week, is finally here. It comes first in violent bursts that last for a few minutes, then dies away before beginning again, each time more sustained. It’s been four days since the President declared a federal emergency. But then the hurricane does what hurricanes do: it throws a curveball. It shifts course and turns left. By Saturday afternoon, Hurricane Irma has peeled off the northern coast of Cuba, gathered strength, and is hooking up Florida’s West coast, through Naples and Sarasota, and on up toward Tampa.
        No one is prepared for this. Some families on Florida’s Atlantic coast, in Miami and Palm Beach, had evacuated to Tampa. The city now looks like it could be flooded under five feet of water. “What looked like a good idea two days ago might not look like such a good idea anymore,” says Mike Brennan, a hurricane expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
        By 7 p.m., both the National Hurricane Center in Miami and Miami-Dade County’s emergency response offices are on lockdown. No one is allowed to go outside. On the TV, reporters struggle to keep their hoods on. They yell into their microphones and blink rain out of their eyes. </p>
    <h3>The Experience with Irma</h3>
    <p>Hurricane Irma is poised to inflict the most widespread outages ever experienced by many of Florida’s utilities, and residents should be prepared to go days or weeks without power, utility officials say.

            The storm is projected to cut power for 190,000 customers of Orlando Utilities Commission, or 80 percent of homes and businesses in the city, and more than 4 million customers of Florida Power & Light Co across the state, according to the calculations guiding the gathering of supplies and labor needed to restore power.   
            Duke Power anticipated more than 1 million customers will be without electricity. It’s the biggest power company in Central Florida with nearly 517,000 customers in Orange and Seminole counties alone and 1.8 million in a Florida service area that spreads to the Panhandle.</p>
    <h3>Aftermath of Irma</h3>
    <p>At least two people were killed during the storm in Orange County. About 900,000 homes and businesses were still without power Monday night in five Central Florida counties, and residents came outside after hours indoors to find downed trees blocking streets and damaging homes and cars.
        And about 4 a.m. Monday, a lake in west Orange County’s Orlo Vista neighborhood overflowed leading to flooding. Orange County firefighters and members of the National Guard pulled more than 200 people from 500 homes and took them to local shelters.</p>
